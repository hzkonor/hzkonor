<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Conor</h1>

I'm currently building applications in C# for a company, while learning C, Java and so on at University.

Apart from that, I sometimes write on [vrakonor](https://vrak.konor.fr) and I like to try new tools (try [TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) or [Micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) if you like terminal-based apps). I also love [Typst](https://typst.app), I made a [template](https://github.com/hzkonor/bubble-template) and I would like to contribute more.

Have a good day âš¡ !
