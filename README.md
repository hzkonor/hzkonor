# Hello world 🐙

French student in apprenticeship, developing web applications and enhancing industrial software solutions. 
Based around Lyon IRL but you can find me at most places on the web.

Apart from that, I sometimes write on [vrakonor](https://vrak.konor.fr) and I like to try new tools (try [TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) or [Micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) if you like terminal-based apps). I also love [Typst](https://typst.app), I made a [template](https://github.com/hzkonor/bubble-template) and I would like to contribute more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **I moved to GitLab 🦊**
> 
> I’ve shifted my personal projects over to GitLab because I’m uncomfortable supporting Microsoft‑owned platforms. (yeah I know that GitLab is not necessarily the *best* alternative, but I use it at work, so it feels more comfortable to me). My account has the same name though : [hzkonor](https://gitlab.com/hzkonor/)

Feel free to reach out from my [contact page](https://me.konor.fr) (in 🇫🇷 or 🇬🇧)

Have a good day ⚡ !
